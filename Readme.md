Frontend (commits-history-app-frontend folder) and backend (commits-history-app-backend folder) are in the same repo, in the root path there is a package json that have three npm commands:
* **install-app:** Go throw the folders and install all the dependecies
* **start-backend:** intialize the Nestjs backend
* **start-frontend:** intialize the React js frontend

The backend will run in port 3000 by default and the frontend on 5173. 

If you want to change the backend port change the value directly in code on file ```main.ts``` in root directory, line 9

```
await app.listen(3000);
```

If you change the backend port, add the variable BACKEND-PORT on ```commits-history-app-fronted/.env``` to maintain a connection witout any issue
